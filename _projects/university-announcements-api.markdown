My schoolâ€™s announcement service is awful so I scrape the info and provide it via a rest api so that a better one may rise.

This is an example of an email every student and faculty member receives daily.

Most people I've talked to either immediately delete the email or have a filter that immediately sends the email to the trash.

There is very good information burried in these emails and it's unfortunate that due to the poor presentation students ignore it. I am going to make a twitter bot to announce this info so that people are much more likely to absorb it.
